# Housing Prices Prediction - Kaggle Project

## Overview
This project is a beginner-level Kaggle competition focused on predicting housing prices using machine learning models. It provides hands-on experience in data cleaning, feature engineering, and model building using real-world data.

## Key Learnings
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data quality.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using visualizations to identify patterns and relationships between features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from the existing data to improve model performance.
- **Modeling**: Building and evaluating various machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- **Model Evaluation**: Analyzing the accuracy of the predictions using RMSE and other metrics.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
